# CSS-Basics

⭐ there are 2 types of displays, block, and inline. Block means one tag will take the whole line space and will not allow any other tag to come along the way. Inline means the tag is taking just the space it needs, and not the whole line.

⭐ display flex means taking out the display block or inline from the tag and deciding it's own display and then applying some alignment vertically and horizontally to it.

⭐ align items is to align the tag vertically to the centre, start, or end.

⭐Justify content is used to align the tag horizontally to the centre, left, right, or spaced.

⭐ flex direction is used to aligns all the boxes inside a container having a display-flex, in row or columns!
